# hospital-discharge-delays-analysis

This repository contains a simulated case study on hospital discharge delays, using R for data analysis and visualization.

## 🧪 Purpose
To demonstrate how data science can be applied to identify, quantify, and reduce operational inefficiencies in hospitals — specifically delays between medical discharge orders and actual patient departures.

## 📊 Methods Used
- Descriptive statistics
- Chi-squared test (for categorical delay distributions)
- t-test (for continuous discharge time comparison)
- ggplot2 visualizations

## 🧰 Tools
- Language: R
- Libraries: `ggplot2`, `dplyr`
- Environment: Simulated data for educational purposes

## 📈 Key Outcomes
- Visual identification of discharge bottlenecks
- Statistically significant improvement after a mock intervention
- Translation of abstract management theory (e.g., Savall & Zardet) into measurable, testable actions

## 📂 Files
- `discharge_delay_summary_plot.R`: Comparison of delay categories before vs after intervention
- `discharge_boxplot_analysis.R`: Statistical t-test and boxplot of real discharge times

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This is a mock dataset created for demonstration only. It does not reflect real patient data from the Hospital de Temuco or any healthcare institution.
